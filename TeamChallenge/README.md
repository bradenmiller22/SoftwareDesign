# Team Challenge - Connect 4 - Software Design

## Overview
This project was completed as part of a collaborative **team challenge** in the Software Design course. The focus was on teamwork, GUI application design, and implementation of interactive visual elements using JavaFX.

The final product is a dynamic animation-based JavaFX application developed by a team of students working together to integrate multiple Java design principles and visual components.

## Objectives
- Collaborate effectively using Git version control
- Apply JavaFX animation features
- Use object-oriented principles to structure reusable and interactive components
- Ensure all GUI actions are responsive and intuitive

## Features
- Dynamic visual animation and transitions using JavaFX `Timeline` and `Canvas`
- Real-time user input through buttons or controls
- Modular codebase using classes for UI logic and drawing behavior
- Team-based development process with Git collaboration

## How to Run
1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**
2. Ensure JavaFX is properly configured
3. Run the `Main.java` file to launch the application

## Notes
- If using JavaFX for the first time, make sure to add VM options for JavaFX modules in your run configuration.
- Developed collaboratively as part of the final project/team sprint in the course.
